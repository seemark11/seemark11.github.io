abstract: "The epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) is crucial for cancer progression and chemoresistance. EMT is a dynamic process with multiple phases that change cell migration and invasion activity. We used pan-cancer expression data to find 14-LncRNAs that had a high correlation with the EMT markers VIM, CDH1, FN1, SNAI1, and SNAI2. The expression of 14 EMT-associated LncRNA, which also showed high cancer specificity, was used to calculate the pan-cancer EMT score. The EMT score was then applied to the 32 cancer types to classify them as epithelial, epithelial-mesenchymal, mesenchymal-epithelial, or mesenchymal tumors. We discovered that the EMT score is a poor prognostic predictor and that as tumor mesenchymal nature increased, patient survival decreased. We also showed that the cell of origin did not influence the EMT nature of tumors. Pathway analysis employing protein expression data revealed that the PI3K pathway is the most crucial in determining the EMTness of tumors. Further, we divided CCLE-cell lines into EMT classes and discovered that mesenchymal cells, which exhibited higher PI3K pathway activation, were more sensitive to PI3K inhibitors than epithelial cells. We identified Linc01615 as a mesenchymal LncRNA whose expression significantly correlated with survival in several cancer types. We showed that Linc01615 is regulated by the TGFÎ²-STAT3 pathway in a feedback loop. Knockdown of Linc01615 inhibited cell proliferation and migration by regulating the PI3K pathway and mesenchymal markers. We also identified RP4-568C11.4 as an epithelial cancer marker. We showed that knocking down RP4-568C11.4 decreased cell growth but not migration. In addition, we discovered that ESR1 regulates RP4-5681C11.4 in breast cancer. Taken together, we have developed a pan-cancer EMT signature. Also, we found two new LncRNAs that have different effects on cancer development and EMT."
