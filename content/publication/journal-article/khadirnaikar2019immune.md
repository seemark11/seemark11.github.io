abstract: "Kidney Renal Clear Cell Carcinoma (KIRC) is a significant cause of cancer-related deaths. Here, we aim to identify the LncRNAs associated with the immune system and characterise their clinical utility in KIRC. A total of 504 patients’ data was used from TCGA-GDC. In silico correlation analysis identified 143 LncRNAs associated with immune-related genes (r $>$ 0.7, P $<$ 0.05). K-means consensus method clustered KIRC samples in three immune clusters, namely cluster C1, C2, and C3 based on the expression of 143 immune-related LncRNAs. Kaplan-Meier analysis showed that C3 patients survived significantly worse than the other two clusters (P $<$ 0.0001). A comparison of TCGA miRNA, mRNA cluster with immune cluster showed the independence and robustness of immune clusters (HR = 2.02 and P = 2.12 $\\times 10^{−8}$). The GSEA and CIBERSORT analysis showed high enrichment of poorly activated T-cells in C3 patients. To define LncRNA immune prognostic signature, we randomly divided the TCGA sample into discovery and validation sets. By utilising multivariate Cox regression analysis, we identified and validated a seven LncRNA immune prognostic signature score (LIPS score) (HR = 1.43 and P = 2.73 $\\times  10^{−6}$) in KIRC. Comparison of LIPS score with all the clinical factors validated its independence and superiority in KIRC prognosis. In summary, we identified LncRNAs associated with the immune system and showed the presence of prognostic subtypes of KIRC patients based on immune-related LncRNA expression. We also identified a novel immune LncRNA based gene-signature for KIRC patients’ prognostication."
